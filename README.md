# Image Processing Project

(SW.BUILD) Level 1 objectives:
- Given a C program split across different modules and files, identify dependencies of different types among them.
- Apply knowledge of the C language and common libraries to successfully build and link programs using specific syntactic constructs and/or libraries.
- Use CMake to configure components of a single software project to build and link correctly.

(perf.rep) Level 1 objectives:
- Explain the various parts of a process's memory layout.
- Convert values among binary, octal, hexadecimal, decimal, and (where appropriate) ASCII formats.
- Select C programming constructs and types that optimize for a program's speed or memory usage.

(perf.mem) Level 1 objectives:
- Recall the basic levels and operation of a typical computer's memory hierarchy.
- Given a cache specification and memory access pattern, compute caching-related metrics such as hit/miss rates and average access time.
- Design programs that take advantage of caching behavior to optimize a program's speed.
